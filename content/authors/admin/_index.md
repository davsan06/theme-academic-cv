    summary: |
      Visited Prof. Dr. David Alonso at the Beecroft Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (BIPAC), University of Oxford, to collaborate on the cross-correlation between galaxy clustering in photometric datasets and cosmic microwave background radiation observed with state-of-the-art ground-based observatories. During this time, I was a Balzan Junior Research Fellow at New College, actively participating in academic discussions and engaging with the community through cultural events.

    summary: |
      Visited Dr. Javier Sánchez and Prof. Dr. Chihway Chang at the University of Chicago and Fermilab, where we developed the joint analysis of weak lensing and galaxy clustering using the first-year data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). This work was conducted with LSST-DESC pipelines, serving as a precursor project for the upcoming LSST imaging survey.
      
  - title: María de Maeztu FPI fellowship
    date: "2020-09-01"
    awarder: Ministry of Science of Spain
    summary: |
      Received four years of funding to develop my PhD thesis in the Grupo de Cosmología Observacional at CIEMAT (Madrid) under the supervision of Dr. Ignacio Sevilla, Dr. Javier Sánchez (SCSci), and Dr. Eusebio Sánchez. My research focused on obtaining the joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering results for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and developing a precursor project for the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), preparing for the exploitation of upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory observations.

# About Me
I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in the **Astro(particle)physics and Cosmology** group led by Prof. Dr. Marcelle Soares-Santos at the **University of Zurich**, specializing in **weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering, and gravitational wave cosmology** using **standard sirens**. My research focuses on developing **statistical methods** for analyzing **large-scale galaxy surveys**, with a strong emphasis on **modeling theoretical systematics**, including the impact of **baryons, intrinsic alignments, and galaxy bias**.  

  I developed my **PhD at CIEMAT (Madrid)**, where I worked on the **joint analysis of weak lensing and galaxy clustering** in the **Dark Energy Survey (DES)**. I am currently **co-leader of the Modeling and Validation Analysis Team** for the **3x2pt analysis** in **DES Year 6**, focusing on **systematic validation and theoretical modeling**.  

  In addition to my work with **DES**, I contribute to preparations for upcoming **Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST** cosmological analyses.
